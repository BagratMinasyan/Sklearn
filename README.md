# Machine Learning Projects with scikit-learn

This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects implemented using scikit-learn. The projects cover various tasks such as multiclass classification, regression, pipelines, column transformer, data preprocessing, handling missing values, grid search, etc.

## Projects Implemented

### 1. Multiclass Classification

- Description: Implementing machine learning models to classify instances into multiple classes.
- Algorithms Used: Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), etc.
- Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix, etc.

### 2. Regression

- Description: Building predictive models to estimate continuous target variables.
- Algorithms Used: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting, etc.
- Evaluation Metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), R-squared, etc.

### 3. Pipelines and Column Transformer

- Description: Constructing data processing pipelines to automate feature engineering and model building.
- Components: Data preprocessing, feature scaling, feature selection, model fitting, etc.
- Techniques: Pipeline composition, ColumnTransformer for handling different types of features, etc.

### 4. Handling Missing Values

- Description: Strategies for dealing with missing data in the dataset.
- Techniques Used: Imputation methods such as mean, median, mode imputation, K-nearest neighbors imputation, etc.

### 5. Grid Search and Hyperparameter Tuning

- Description: Optimizing model performance by tuning hyperparameters using grid search.
- Parameters Tuned: Learning rate, regularization strength, kernel parameters, etc.
- Cross-Validation: Employing cross-validation to select the best combination of hyperparameters.
